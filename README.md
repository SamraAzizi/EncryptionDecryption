# Encryption and Decryption Program

This is a simple Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting messages using a base64 encoding scheme.

## Features

- Encrypt messages
- Decrypt messages
- User-friendly GUI
- Simple password protection for encryption and decryption

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

    ```sh
    python script_name.py
    ```
3. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the text box.
4. Enter the password (`1234`) in the secret key field.
5. Click "ENCRYPT" to encrypt the message or "DECRYPT" to decrypt it.
6. Use the "RESET" button to clear the fields.
